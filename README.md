# CNN-for-Curated-Colon-Disease-
In the field of medical imaging, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become a potential tool for precise and automatic illness identification. This research suggests a CNN- based method for the diagnosis of colon illnesses in wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) images using ResNet, a kind of deep neural network
